Please refer to the data sheet in the PDF folder on how to hook the switch up.  Refer to the sketch for the pin names and numbers.  It is recommended to not change the pin numbers.  Remember the VLC pin must not be hooked up when powering up the system, it needs to be powered after the fact.  This pin requires at least 7.2 volts acording to the datasheet.  A fast test bench work around can be done with 9v with two 1n4007 diodes in series.  Furthermore, the backlight LEDs need series resistors to power them.  Again refer to the pdf for the values.
